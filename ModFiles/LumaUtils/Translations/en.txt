LumaUtils first ever build made was from september 15 2024 
LumaUtils was supposed to be a continuation of FPE
We do not talk about gman running animation.
Jason 666 helped me with this
originally, lumautils was supposed to be just a mod to prevent raid bots
lumautils mobile version could become something in the future.
lumautils could have been called LCM, aka lumaah's custom multiplayer
first thing i added in lumautils was a simple Hello World print
what do you mean tax evasion
"I am inside your walls, wha-, \nwhy do i hear someone slamming a hammer at the wall, HELP !!",

Fun Fact: i rewrote asset updater 17 times, kill me please
"Popups used to break and show a white screen all over the screen, \nme & rezz have been blinded 11 times while testing",
I once thought of cancelling LumaUtils, i don't regret still making it to this day
"When i first thought of reworked survival the original idea was adding a secret wave 11\n with a ai japanese run away theme song.\n And yes the music does exists.",
If you think about it, most st3 mods exists because of me
If i ever stop making LumaUtils, i'll probably make the source code public
I secretly have a leaked build of guardian collection but don't tell anyone ok ?
The Three Moles was created on the 27th of August 2024
makstubby, my beloved
original lumautils source folder name was becbenzenmod
i once got so tired of asset updater that i asked chatgpt for help. dear god shit was even worse
i almost got my whole E: drive deleted while making this
Deathmatch loading text is literally a cuphead reference
Deathmatch was randomly added, i was bored and wanted to see if it still worked.
LumaUtils was supposed to just be a blacklist mod
Cabinets is a fucking ideaman, where do he gets those ideas ??
I managed to make my pc bluescreen because of lumautils :cry:
run away peter griffin ai cover doesn't exist.
I tried running lumautils on the st3 android port, crashed my phone
There's multiple other games references in LumaUtils
I've been sleeping in a cardboard box
TubbyCraft was supposed to be in 0.1b but it broke down, just like me haha.
The Devil Among Us 2.3 Drops in 2205.
"Infinite Upgrades were supposed to be just MK3, \nbut it bugged out so... here we are",
Life gave you lemons? take them out the freezer.

Do not ever type 'itwasgood' while having slendytubbies classic selected.
Among Others name comes from the fact that's it's a mod among other mods.
Sean knows about LumaUtils.
Technically speaking, i've thought of emotes before Meloh did.

The trio was brought back together.
The walls are breathing.
Reality is a suggestion.
The air tastes wrong.
Your thoughts aren't yours.
Something is counting down.
It’s already too late.
The silence is deafening.
There’s something breathing behind you…
Someone is watching, always watching.
Their laughter is distorted.
The screams never ended.
You're the reason behind this.
You feel yourself starting to go insane.

My logic is the absolute.
The trees are not trees.
Logic is the final border.
Are you looking at the screen?
The end is nigh.
There are no faces.
Go outside, look at the sky.
Give me control.
You will succumb.
You are a quitter.
Do you remember being born?
I will put you back together.
Nothing is worth the risk.
You are not you.
The mind is a tyrant.
Don't look away.
Behind you.
You're dying.
Who are you?
No more sun, no more joy, only hunger.
You're going to be one of us.
Kill him
Are you looking at the screen?
He can't stop us.
The Custards changed us. They will change him too.
I was like you… once.
The hills are watching.
Noo-Noo knows everything.
He can run, but he can't hide.
He protected them. But who will protect him now?
I will put you back together.
We will make you stronger.
His risks are worth nothing.
The Guardian falls tonight.
To whomever it may concern:\n\nWe are about to release an all out attack.\n\nAnd we’re coming for <color=red>you</color>.\n Sincerely - The Newborns.

Response:
<b><i>Main Land (S2)</i></b>\n\n5 years after the events of the disastrous infection,\n the Main Land is absent of any remnants to what it once was. \nNow being swamp-like, corpses for landmarks and a monstrous form \n<color=#8800ff>Tinky Winky</color> has took upon himself.
<b><i>Lake (S2)</i></b>\n\nThe Lake, once a peaceful spot, has transformed into a muddy swamp.\n Dead trees and broken bridges dot the landscape, and the air is thick with the smell of decay.\n <color=#00610f>Lake Dipsy</color>, a monstrous version of a regrown head from the former Teletubby,\n lurks in the waters, ready to attack anyone who approaches.
<b><i>Satellite Station (S2)</i></b>\n\nFive years after the infection ravaged Teletubby Land, the Satellite Station lies in ruins. Once a hub for communication, \nits halls are now silent except for the unsettling ticking of <color=#ff3030>Po</color>, \nwho wanders aimlessly through the <color=#b30000>dead</color> facility.
<b><i>Secret Lair (S2)</i></b>\n\nHidden beneath the Main Land, the Secret Lair remains a place of mystery and horror. \nThe sewers now house the Newborns,\n deformed creatures that patrol the dark tunnels, \ntheir cries echoing throughout the hollow pipes.
<b><i>Outskirts (S2)</i></b>\n\nThe Outskirts, an arid desert with ruins and dead trees, are now under the watch of <color=#ffde3b>Laa-Laa</color>\n in her infected form. She blindly roams the area, guarding the entrance to the Satellite Station,\n ensuring no one can escape the horrors within.
<b><i>Training Maze (S2)</i></b>\n\nThe Training Maze, a labyrinth of gray metal walls, serves as a challenge for those who enter.\n Inside, multiple threats await: \n<color=#00610f>Lake Dipsy</color> \n<color=#ffde3b>Laa-Laa</color> \n<color=#ff3030>Po</color> \nand a Newborn.
